# Vision-Based-autonomous-navigation-for-a-Robot-in-indoor-environment
This work aims to provide an experimental study of visual SLAM methods in indoor environment with different cameras and IMU data fused with camera processed data. Performance analysis of several VSlam techniques like RTAB-Map Slam, ORB-Slam, OpenVSlam, Mono-Slam, RGBD-Slam, Kimera using various sensors like Open MV M7, Kinect V1, Intel RealSense D435, RPLidar A1 is to be done on a designed and machined robot using ROS and gazebo for its simulation. Detailed comparitive study and analysis of various path planning algorithms like RRT, RRT*, RRT-Connect will be done.
